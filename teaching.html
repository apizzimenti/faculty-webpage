                        hard, and math in college is even harder. If you feel like you're

                        we can discuss your coursework (even from other classes), class
                        schedule, career plans, and whatever else you might want to chat about.

                        drill-and-kill problem-solving doesn't make us better mathematicians,
                        but <a target=_blank href="https://bit.ly/3ljW1BN">messing around and being creative do</a>.

                            The PhD LaunchPad Program is a three-week transitional learning
                            experience for incoming doctoral and Masters students. The Program
                            comprises two seven-day courses plus a field trip, and is designed to:

                                    detail what knowledge they are expected to have in their first year
                                    of graduate study at Mason;
                                </li>

                                    preview material that's expected to be covered in Algebra (MATH:621)
                                    and Linear Analysis (MATH:675), the typical fall-semester prelim courses;

                                <li>
                                    help students familiarize themselves with Mason's Fairfax campus,
                                    campus resources, the math department and its organization, and the
                                    structure of the PhD program;
                                </li>

                            </ul>
                            The course runs from July 24th to August 11th, 2023 at George Mason's
                            Fairfax Campus.
